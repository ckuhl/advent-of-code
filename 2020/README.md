# Advent of Code 2020

A partial attempt before I lost interest.

---

Now picking up November 2023 as I work through the Advent of Code backlog.

Compared to my [2019 run through], this time I will be working through it in Racket my beloved.

The focus continues to be on completion over getting fancy with things. Once I get a year under my belt, then I will start thinking about style points.

I think too I will attempt to focus on mostly-default Racket libraries.
In essence this means `#lang racket` + a few modest imports.
In future attempts I may expand to more generous libraries but I feel that at this point I want to focus more on building the basics before running.

[2019 run through]: ../2019/README.md
