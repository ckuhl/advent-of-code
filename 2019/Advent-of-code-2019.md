# Advent of Code: 2019

Decided to take a break from this Racket programming business.

Will instead work with Python, which I am more familiar with.

It's a treat, y'know?

## Environment details

- Python3.11
- That's it
- idk an IDE I guess?
- It's pretty stock
- I'm just here trying to enjoy the things I can't enjoy elsewhere

## Featuring the IntCode Computer!

Will need to work out a way to show it off at the end.
For now, it lives in `common.py`.
