# Advent of Code: 2019

Decided to take a break from this Racket programming business.

Will instead work with Python, which I am more familiar with.

It's a treat, y'know?

## Environment details

- Python3.11
    - That's it
- Aiming to use only built-in Python libraries
    - Equal parts stubbornness and laziness against managing dependencies

## Featuring the IntCode Computer!

Will need to work out a way to show it off at the end.
For now, it lives in `common.py`.

## Structure

- Daily python files in the base directory
- `./input` for input text files
