# Advent of Code: 2023

Now feeling slightly more ~overconfident~ _comfortable_ with Advent of Code, I am going to try it in a new-to-me language this time: [Lua]!

Motivation is equal parts it is kind-of applicable (for scripting [NeoVim], [nginx (via OpenResty)], etc.) and it looks fun to use [LÖVE].

[Lua]: https://www.lua.org/
[NeoVim]: https://neovim.io/doc/user/lua.html
[nginx (via OpenResty)]: https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#readme
[LÖVE]: https://www.love2d.org/
