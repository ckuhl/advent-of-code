# Advent of Code 2021

In which we take another go at completing all of the Advent of Code problems.
This time around I am somehow the ringleader for works AoC private leaderboard
/ group, so I feel slightly more motivated to actually follow through this
year.

Language: Racket 8.3

---

And another pickup at a later date.

This time using a few more "advanced" (not actually advanced) Racket libraries.
To contextualize how much later this is happening, I am now using Racket 8.11 instead of 8.3.
This is also intended as more of a 'victory lap' approach to the other attempt.

Compare this (when completed, I suppose) to the [2020] approach.

[2020]: ../2020/README.md
