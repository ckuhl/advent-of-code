# Advent of Code: 2018

I have a new old laptop.
I got it a good while ago, but I have not had the chance to use it for a while.
So I finally pulled it out of deep storage, dusted it off, and dutifully installed Haiku on it.

Now I am trying to get my sea legs under me on this new system, and so what better way to do this than Advent of Code?
I am trying to catch up on previous years, and also use it as a motivation to do it in some new, interesting way.


# Day 1
- Oops, need to set up git configuration for pushing and not juts pulling
- Figuring out where Haiku stores git configurations
    - Now wondering how I juggle the same configuration in different paths / repositories

# Day 2
- Smooth sailing, no major issues
- Python is familiar
